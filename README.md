# Goal Tracker Client Side

  Client-side repo for full stack web application. The application purpose is
  to allow users to keep track of their goals.

## The Idea

The reason I decided to make this application was that I use the Pomodoro
technique often, but most of the tools out there for there use the  Pomodoro
technique only based on a  timer set on 4 intervals of 25 minutes each with 5
minutes between each interval. What I want to do for this project was ultimately
make a goal tracking system based on the Pomodoro technique, meaning the user is
able to take action on their goal using the Pomodoro technique within the
application.

## Technology Used:

The main front-end framework is built on Javascript, HTML5, and CSS. Utilizing
Bootstrap also takes part in building the client side, this can include the
Sign-In navigation bar, as well as the effects on the buttons when hovering over.
Bootstrap also allow me to use modals in different sections of the client, such
as the Sign-up and Change Password. Another big part of my client side is
utilizing Handlebars, these, are used for displaying the user goals once
created, they are also attached to my API.
